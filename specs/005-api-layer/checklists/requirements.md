# Specification Quality Checklist: API Layer

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (1 open: weekly vs. monthly digests)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation pass 1: all items pass except the open [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker in Assumptions (weekly vs. monthly digests). It is a scope decision only the user can make, so it is not guessed.
- Implementation choices (FastAPI, in-memory index vs. SQLite cache) are kept out of the spec body. The spec mentions the index only as a behavior (FR-009, FR-010); the choice is left to planning.
- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`.
